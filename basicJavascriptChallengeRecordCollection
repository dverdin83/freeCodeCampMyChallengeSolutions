/* Basic JavaScript - Record Collection
You are given a JSON object representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has several properties and a unique id number as its key. Not all albums have complete information.

Write a function which takes an album's id (like 2548), a property prop (like "artist" or "tracks"), and a value (like "Addicted to Love") to modify the data in this collection.

If prop isn't "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), update or set the value for that record album's property.

Your function must always return the entire collection object.

There are several rules for handling incomplete data:

If prop is "tracks" but the album doesn't have a "tracks" property, create an empty array before adding the new value to the album's corresponding property.

If prop is "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), push the value onto the end of the album's existing tracks array.

If value is empty (""), delete the given prop property from the album.
*/

/*PSEUDOCODE
1. Declare variable updateRecords and assign it as a function with id, prop, and value as arguments.
2. IF prop argument isn't (find out using hasOwnProperty) "tracks" AND value argument isn't empty ("") access collection record using argument id and push value of value argument onto property of prop argument onto collection record.
3. Find record in collection using id argument and if prop argument is "tracks" AND recird doesn't have "tracks" property (use hasOwnProperty to find out), create an array with key value pair [prop, value] and push onto collection JSON object with the record corresponding to id argument.
4. If record found using id argument has "tracks" property AND property argument is tracks and value isn't empty, push argument value onto existing record on tracks property array.
5. If argument value is empty delete the property from collection object from the given record id and property corresponding to prop argument.
