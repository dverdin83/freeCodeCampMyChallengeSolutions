/*PSEUDOCODE
1. Pass argument into factorialize function.
2.. Declare variable total and initialize to 1.
3... Declare and initialize variable in a for loop which runs num + 1 times where num is the argument.
4.... In the for loop multiply n by total.
5.....Assign product of total and num to the variable total.
6......After for loop is complete assign the value of total to variable num.
7.......Return num.
